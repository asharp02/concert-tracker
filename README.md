# concert-tracker

The ultimate live music guide! Explore an artist's tour locations on an interactive map and get live travel times to each show ðŸŽ¸
The idea for this project was sparked immediately after attending an amazing concert. I wanted to quickly see the closest shows on the same tour along
with an estimated travel time. This project achieves exactly that: a map populated with all of an artists' upcoming shows + an ordered list of closest shows to my current
location.
